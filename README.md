# parsercisco3570
Purpose

The script is intended to analyze a Cisco Switch 3750 configuration file and extract relevant information such as VLANs, interfaces, IP addresses, default gateway, SNMP communities, and NTP servers. The extracted information is then printed on the screen for easy viewing.

Implementation

The script utilizes regular expressions to identify and extract specific configuration elements from the input file. It defines regex patterns for each configuration element, such as vlan, interface, ip address, shutdown, hostname, default-gateway, snmp-server community, snmp-server host, and ntp server.

The script reads the configuration file line by line and applies the corresponding regex patterns to identify and extract relevant information. For each interface, it also checks for the switchport mode access and spanning-tree portfast keywords to determine if the interface is configured as an access port and enabled portfast, respectively.

Finally, the script prints the extracted information in a structured manner, including switch name, VLANs, interfaces with their IP addresses, default gateway, SNMP communities, SNMP hosts, and NTP servers.

Input

The script takes the Cisco Switch 3750 configuration text file as input. The file should be in a standard Cisco configuration format, with each line representing a configuration command or keyword.

Output

The script outputs the extracted configuration information to the console. The output includes the switch name, VLANs, interfaces with their IP addresses, default gateway, SNMP communities, SNMP hosts, and NTP servers.

Benefits

The script provides a straightforward and efficient way to analyze Cisco Switch 3750 configurations. It helps network administrators quickly identify and understand key configuration parameters, such as VLANs, interfaces, IP addresses, and other network settings. This can be useful for troubleshooting, configuration audits, and gaining insights into network topology and device configurations.

Overall, the script serves as a helpful tool for managing and analyzing Cisco Switch 3750 configurations. It streamlines the process of extracting and understanding relevant configuration information, making it easier for network administrators to effectively manage their network infrastructure.
